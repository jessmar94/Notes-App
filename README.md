# Notes-App
## Summary 

Week 7 project to complete a front-end, single page web app in pure JavaScript. We will be writing our tests without a testing library.

This project is broken up into 15 steps. More details can be found here: https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/further_javascript 

This project will help me towards these gols:
- I can TDD anything. 
- I can write code that is easy to change. 

## Plan 
User stories:
```bash 
As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want
```
```bash 
As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember
```
```bash 
As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note
```

## Project Status 
- On the first day of the challenge, Roberta and I just got our head around setting up tests without a testing library. 
- On Day 1 of the challenge, I worked through steps 1-5 with Sid on [his repo](https://github.com/smasonmalik/Notes_app).
- For the rest of the week, I predominantly worked on my own via [my repo](https://github.com/jessmar94/Notes-App) as most of my pairs were off.
